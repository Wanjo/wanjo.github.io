                    Biochemistry offers path to help reduce losses during potato handling and storage
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Massive losses in the United States’ number one vegetable crop, potatoes, aren’t only due to pests or drought, they’re due to damage in the handling and storage of potatoes over the months of storage on their way to the supermarket as fresh potatoes or as potato chips or fries.
                </p>
                <p> As Mike Wolterbeek reports for Nevada Today, 
                <br> a biochemistry approach that seeks to identify 
                <br> genetic characteristics of the wound healing process 
                <br> in potatoes has had success in a project led by Dylan Kosma, 
                <br> a biochemist in the College of Agriculture, Biotechnology & 
                <br> Natural Resources at the University of Nevada, Reno.

                    Expert opinion on innovations in the potato processing industry
                </h3>
                <p>
                    “The potato processing market has been steadily increasing in the last years and this trend is expected to continue. Following this growth, many companies working in this field have presented different innovations in the recent years: new storage options, new pretreatments, new fryers, and new cutting systems.”

                    So says Emerson Jiménez Barajas, Application Director, FAM & Stumabo International, in an article published by Potato Processing International.
